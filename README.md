Code 101: Intro to Software Development & Careers in Tech
-----------------------

Welcome to Code 101!

First thing's first: Let's get your computer set up. 

In order to write code on your computer, you need to download and install some new tools. The below guides may contain terms you've never heard of, but you should still be able to follow along and get your computer set up so you're all ready to start Code 101 at 9:00AM.

**If you have trouble doing so, don't fret! Just arrive to Code 101 early at 8:00 AM, so we can help you get set up.**

### Pre-work

##### 1. Ensure your laptop is in good shape and is up to the task of coding.

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 2. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"

##### 3. Download and Install Ryver

We use a messaging app called Ryver to share resources, chat, and collaborate before, during, and after the workshop. 
You can either use the app in your browser (codefellowspdx.ryver.com) or use the following link to download the installable app:

[Ryver Downloads](ryver.com/downloads/).

Prior to Code 101, you’ll get an email from us to join the Code 101 team in Ryver. (You won't be able to join prior to being invited).
